Property/Issue	Internet in VRF	Internet in GRT	Summary
BGP Free Core	Out of the box	Have to use MPLS and /30 - /32 MPLS label allocation	VRF is better. Less action required for VRF
Prefix visibility at PE	Using unique RD per PE or BGP ADD-PATH 1 for VPNv4 and/or VPNv6	Using BGP ADD-PATH 1	Unique RD is out off the box functionality. No additional features required.
Optimal path selection regardless of RR hierarchy	Using unique RD per PE (increases RIB memory consumption) or BGP Optimal Route Reflection 2 for VPNv4/VPNv6	Using BGP ADD-PATH 1 (increases RIB memory consumption) or BGP Optimal Route Reflection 2	It depends. Unique RD might be better solution, until PE has scarce RIB resources
Route oscillation 3 issue	Using unique RD per PE	Using BGP ADD-PATH 1 together with Advertise the Group Best Paths 4	VRF is better, no additional features required
Flexible and simple approach to distinguish End-user, Transit, IXPs and Others	Built-in by RT import/export policy	Not Available	VRF is better
Flexible and simple approach to distribute routes partially	Built-in by RT import/export policy	BGP-ORF based on Prefix list or BGP Community (Nokia only) policy	VRF is better. BGP-ORF introduces big configuration overhead
Traffic diversion for DDoS mitigation	Easy to diverse traffic by using RD and RT manipulation. BGP Flowspec also an option	Have to use BGP Flowspec and other technics using protocols like BGP-LU	It depends. Traffic diversion by RT is less granular than BGP Flowspec. BGP Flowspec for VRF might not be supported by some vendors
Customer isolation	Built-in	Not Available	VRF is better
Prefix filtration on Egress per BGP peer	Using RTC/RTF. Filtering can be done on RR	BGP-ORF based on Prefix list policy on each PE	RTC/RTF is better approach, but PE have to support certain BGP AFI/SAFI
Low spec devices as Internet PE. Default route + partial BGP Full View (95% of traffic belongs to less than 500 prefixes) 5	Using RTC/RTF and different RT	BGP-ORF based on Prefix list on each PE	VRF is better. BGP-ORF introduces big configuration overhead
Ability to advertise Full View, local prefix, IXP prefixes or any mix of above to the BGP peers	Simple and flexible by using RT and BGP Communities	Complex BGP policies based on BGP communities	VRF is better, because it provides simple and flexible way to control prefix advertisment
Strong demarcation between ISP infrastructure and Public Internet service	Built-in	N/A	VRF is better.
IPv6 Internet	Using 6VPE (VPNv6 AFI/SAFI). Simple	Using 6PE (Complex BGP-LU configuration) and additional label in MPLS stack	VRF is better. It provides unified approach for both IPv4 and IPv6
BGP Fast Reroute	BGP PIC Core and BGP PIC Edge features	BGP ADD-PATH 1 and BGP FRR	It depends on features supported by the network
RIB consumption	+8% + ~80% per Full View VRF 6	No extra RIB memory consumption	GRT is better, no extra RIB resources consumption
FIB consumption	Some vendors might need (might not) extra X% FIB space to store VRF entries	No extra FIB space needed	GRT is better, no extra FIB resources consumption
BGP security features	BGP RPKI, BGP FLow-spec and other BGP security features might not be available in VRF	Most of the BGP security features works in GRT	Currently GRT is better, BGP Security features for 99% implemented in GRT
BGP convergence time	RTC/RTF will affect BGP convergence time	BGP ORF can affect BGP convergence time	It depends. In common case RTC/RTF will increase BGP convergence time
Events to trigger BGP convergence	BGP events only (might not be fast enough).	BGP and IGP events (if NH address propagated via IGP)	It depends. BGP fast convergence might affect stability
BGP features	Vendors might have scarce feature set for BGP in VRF	Most of the BGP features will work in GRT	Currently GRT is better.
MPLS label allocation	Per Prefix - not enough MPLS labels; Per NH/CE -> MPLS labels quantity depends on NH/CE quantity; Per PE in VRF -> additional IP Lookup is needed on PE	Per Prefix - not enough MPLS labels; Per NH/interface -> MPLS labels quantity depends on number of NH/interfaces	Platform depended. Different vendors uses different approach. Per NH/CE mpls label allocation works well for both options
